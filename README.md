# Git Log and History
[Git - git-log Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)

Git log is a really useful tool in the Git toolbelt. It gives you the ability to see the history of this repo at this point.  Within `git log` you will be able to see all the commits and their messages that you have locally in your repository.
